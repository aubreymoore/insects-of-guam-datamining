# Insects of Guam Datamining Project

Students of the AL/BI 345 General Entomology are invited to participate in this project for lab credits in lieu of an individual research project.

## Background

In 1936, O.H. Swezey, an entomologist working for the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association, was sent to Guam to do an insect survey. The results of this survey were published by the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in *Insects of Guam I* in 1942 and *Insects of Guam II* in 1946. 

The objective of the current project is to extract information from PDF copies of *Insects of Guam I and II* as part of an effort to build a biodiversity inventory for Guam.
