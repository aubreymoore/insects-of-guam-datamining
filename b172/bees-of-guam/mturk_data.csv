The male of<br>mczcyi is about 6 mm long, considerably smaller and less robust than the male of .mﬁordi,<br>but very variable in coloration, and in the sculpture of the metathoracic area, which, how-<br>ever, is never of the xaﬂardi pattern. The tibiae are usually bright red, but in one speci-<br>men, which has a brilliant purple abdomen and black tegulae, the middle and hind tibiae<br>are black.

In the Philippine Journal of Science<br>(16: 147, 1920), I wrote of M. mogregari: “This may be the male of Megu~<br>Chile iizetallescens, which occurs in the same two localities. The abdomen is<br>not at all metallic<br> but otherwise, aside from the usual sexual diﬁcerences, the<br>insects are very much alike.” This species has undoubtedly been introduced<br>into Guam from the Philippine Islands.<br>m<br>‘bis bee is widely distributed in Guam, but most of the specimens were<br>collected at Piti. Evidence of its leafcutting activities was conspicuous through—<br>out the island. Young kapok trees were often nearly completely defoliated by<br>this bee, which cuts the circular and oblong bits of the leaves for the lining oi<br>nests, Rose bushes, too, were often nearly defoliated similarly.——O.
