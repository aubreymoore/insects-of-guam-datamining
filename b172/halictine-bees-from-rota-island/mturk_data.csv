I give this a name as it has a very<br>distinctive appearance Typical H. rotaé'mis, seen from in front, looks almost<br>exactly like H. crolaltm‘ae Cockerell from New Caledonia, which however has<br>a shining, olive—green abdomen."

Halictus swezeyi Cockerell.<br>I cannot clearly separate these from H ‘ .rwezeyi which occurs on Guam. On<br>the average, the abdomen is a darker, bluer green, but it is variable.
