Collected by Fullaway in 1911.<br>Described from Brisbane, Australia, where it occurred on H ibixmx tili—<br>acem‘, collected by Ti‘yon. In the collection of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters’<br>Association are some specimens collected on Hibiscus at Suva, Fiji, Beef 12,<br>1904, probably by Perkins. The species is also recorded from New Caledonia<br>and Tahiti. In Guam, growing leaves of Hibilrcux tilia-ceus are infested, and<br>the young insects are hidden by considerable white ﬂocculent waxy material.<br>Commonly found in all places. They are preyed on by larvae of a lacewing ﬂy<br>and a syrphid ﬂy."

Swezey.<br>L. sulfurea was described from Amboina, Moluccas, on a single specimen,<br>without mention of food plant. The variety rubracimta was described from<br>the Philippines as occurring on Calaphyllum inaphyllum, the young feeding<br>beneath the rolled over edge of the leaves, The Guam specimens were reared<br>from the same tree, and similarly situated on the leaves. They agree pretty<br>well With the characters which Uichanco gives as distinctions between the<br>variety and sulfurea, except that the Guam specimens lack the red markings<br>on the abdomen. Uichanco had one female in which these were not evident.<br>He concludes: “When more is known about the Moluccan insect’ the variety<br>rubracimta may ﬁnally have to be merged with the species.”<br>The species didactyla described from Fiji in 1922, on C alophyllum inophyl—<br>[um seems more likely to be the same as Guam material, especially on account<br>of white lines on the thorax which are not mentioned in the description of<br>sulfurea. '<br>As Calopliyllmn inophyllum is widely spread in Paciﬁc tropics, no doubt<br>this psyllid will be found more widely spread when more collecting is done.<br>The tree occurs in Hawaii, but does not have the psyllid."
