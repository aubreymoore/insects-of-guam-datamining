Antmmae differing as illustrated, shafts of all segments distinctly longer than<br>broad, third segment about as long as four plus one half of ﬁve, distal segment as long as<br>three preceding segments combined. Pronotum much less coarsely sculptured than in male,<br>depressions not so deeply impressed as in male. Elytra, except for vestiture, essentially<br>similar to those of male.

The larvae were also found by Swezey as<br>follows: Mt. Tenjo, in Areca palm stump, May 3<br> Sumay Road, in Lumnit—<br>zem ﬂeclicellata, June 23<br> Fadian, in log, Sept. 18<br> Mt. Alifan, from rotten<br>log, May 26 <br> Agana, from rotten log of Pandaims, May 4. Swezey says that<br>the larvae of this beetle were often found abundant in the solid wood of logs<br>on the ground.<br>The fourth segments of the antennae of the male were described by Blair<br>as being slightly longer on the outer edge than the breadth of the apex. How-<br>ever, the proportionate length and breadth of the fourth segment in the male<br>is subject to some variation, and it may be slightly longer than broad, as long<br>as broad or slightly transverse.<br>The male genitalia of the holotype and a Guam specimen have been studied,<br>The illustrations shown here were made from a Guam specimen.
