It is now recorded<br>from Guam for the ﬁrst time. Its caterpillars feed on morning—glory leaves<br>(I pumaea species). They were collected in several stages of growth and a<br>few reared to maturity. The full grown caterpillar is about 60 mm. long, light<br>green with an oblique bar of mauve above the spiracles. The spiracles are oval,<br>light yellow with black centers. The egg is spherical, light green, smooth. They<br>are placed singly on the under side of leaves. They were collected on several<br>occasions. Sometimes the eggs are parasitized. From an egg collected on<br>morning—glory leaf in corn ﬁeld at the Agricultural School, Piti, September 15,<br>18 trichogrammas issued. A larger parasite was reared from eggs a few times<br>and from different localities. This parasite issued from 4 of 9 eggs collected<br>at Piti', July 30, which would be a parasitism of 44 percent. Perhaps these egg<br>parasites are effective on other species of hawkmoths, and account for their<br>scarcity in Guam."
