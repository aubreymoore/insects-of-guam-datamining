In 1936 we procured more specimens of P. urgen-<br>tamm than of all the others. We have 21 specimens of P. argentatum, all but '<br>one from Piti, where they were quite common in and about our residence. The<br>little mud nests were common on walls and in corners of back rooms, These<br>nests are made up of one to six cells in which the wasp stores up small spiders<br>on which its larvae feed. There is considerable parasitism by Melittobz'a<br>hazmiiensir, a tiny parasite whose larvae feed externally on the wasp larvae.<br>There may be up to 100 parasite larvae on one wasp larva. On May 19, a nest<br>containing 6 cells was collected on the scale shed at the Agricultural School,<br>Piti, each cell containing a Pisa cocoon in which were tiny exit holes where<br>parasites had issued<br> hence, a parasitism of 100 percent. On September 24,<br>several nests were collected and examined at the residence. These nests totalled<br>19 cells, the contents of which were: four with dead pisons<br> one with dead<br>spiders, one with caterpillars stored by Pachody-nems maidens<br> two with roach<br>egg case<br> ten had cocoons showing exit holes of M elittobia<br> one had living<br>pupae of M elittobiau In this nest, the parasitism would have been at least 56<br>percent.<br>This wasp occurs in Madagascar, India, Philippines, and Hawaii. It has<br>undoubtedly become introduced into Guam in somewhat recent years, from<br>Hawaii or the Philippines."

It is<br>to be seen searching for caterpillars in grass lands, gardens, ﬁelds, roadsides<br>and in the forests. Leafroller caterpillars are their particular prey. These are<br>used for daily feeding to their larvae in paper nests. The nests are composed<br>of much smaller cells than those of Politics. The cells are vertical, and the<br>nest is usually elongate and hangs on a slant instead of being horizontal and<br>nearly circular as is the Palirte: nest. These nests are commonly found on the<br>under side of palm leaves, in hedges and on mango leaves. One nest found<br>among mango leaves contained 541 cells. This wasp is quick to attack when<br>its nest is disturbed, and the sting is severe for its size. We found several<br>specimens dead with a fungus disease, the same kind as found on Polixter<br>mamémis. This may prove to be Hirsutclla taunt/trad (Cooke)."
