Bull.<br>2: 6, 1906.<br>Three specimens of the delphacid leafhopper Sogata eupampe (Kirkaldy)<br>from Inarajau and one from Agat were found to have been parasitized by a<br>stylopid. This may possibly be Elenchoidex ﬁerkimi, a species recorded as<br>abundant on several species of delphacids in Queensland and Fiji under the<br>name Elem/ms lemicomis Kirby, a misidentiﬁcation according to Pierce who<br>names it as above."
