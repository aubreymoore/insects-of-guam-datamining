Culicidae (194), 1932.<br>This day mosquito was described from Fiji, and also occurs in Samoa. A<br>few were reared from larvae in a water—ﬁlled tree hollow at Barrigada, August<br>28, and from larvae in water—ﬁlled coconut shells on the ground at Piti, October<br>11. In 1937, A. Cruz reared quite a lot of them from larvae in coconut hulls<br>at Mogfog, Nov. 10. This species was determined by W. V. King."

Wash, Proc. 41: 162, ﬁg.<br>1a, 1939.<br>This species was described from an abundance of material collected and<br>reared by us in 1936, and by R. G, Oakley in 1937 and 1938. It is the mos-<br>quito recorded by Fullaway in 1911 as Stegomyia rcutellarix, of which he said:<br>“The latter is very abundant in the forests and makes progress through the<br>brush very unpleasant.” We also were tormented by this day mosquito when-<br>ever out in the gardens, ranches, or forests. This is by far the most abundant<br>species in Guam. Fortunately the effect of their bites is not so severe as it is<br>with some of the other species. The larvae were in only one situation,<br>in water held in the axils of Pandmm: leaves. There are several species of<br>Pandamw in the forests and valleys of Guam, and they are abundant enough<br>everywhere to provide ready breeding places for this mosquito. Furthermore,<br>the rainfall is sufﬁcient to maintain the water supply in the leaf axils. The<br>larvae were always found when searched for in this situation, and sometimes<br>they were reared. The species occurred in all regions, and there is no object<br>in listing the places where collected"
