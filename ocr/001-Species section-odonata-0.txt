Piti, dead specimen on bark of Pithecolabmm tree, Root Agricultural
School, Aug. 19, 1936, collected by a student
Piti, at light, Sept. 12, Swezey,
Oct. 17, Swezey, A wary high-ﬂying species diﬂicult to capture.
Described from a male specimen collected in Guam by Fullaway in 1911.
A male specimen collected in 1936 was submitted to Dr, Kennedy for veriﬁ—
cation. In reply, Dr. Kennedy stated that he had not seen the species panybom
Hagen with which he had compared piraticm in his original description, and
now he says: “My opinion after seeing this second specimen is that it will be
difﬁcult to separate all specimens from Guam from panybeus of Celebes. They
may prove to be one species with study of more material.”
